          <b>World Wide Web</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web is composed primarily of a collection of HTML documents
          linked by hyperlinks. The web was invented in the early 1990's by
          <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> and others. The Web is composed of computers 
          that are optimized for running continuously to host and serve-up 
          webpages (HTML documents). Called <em>servers</em> these computers
          receive requests sent to them by humans and their webbrowsers which
          send requests in the form of the protocol of the web, <em>Hyper Text
          Tranfer Protocol</em> or HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
        </p>
        <p>
           <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> (HTML) is the the main document
           type of the Web although other types of files can also be found--and
           linked to--files such as images, video, audio files, and document
           files besides HTML (for example, pdf documents). HTML is made up of:
           <br><br>1) the text content (what you see on the webpage through your
           browser), and<br>2) mark-up code that tells your browser what the
           text will look like or how it will be displayed.         
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HTTP Protocol</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet uses HTTP to communicate with you, your browser, and
          servers. For example, when you enter the url of, say, Amazon.com
          into your browser, your browser sends a request in HTTP to the 
          server that hosts Amazon's website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Specifics of HTML</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is composed of plain text characters and tags. Tags are a kind of
          code that webbrowsers can understand and use to render or draw the
          various elements of the webpate. In HTML, plain text is rendered as
          plain text. HTML markup tags are enclosed in angled brackets like this:
          <br><br>&lt;html-tag&gt;
          <br><br>Some types of HTML tage require both an opening and a
          closing tag. HTML tags that do not require a closing tag are called
          <em>void tags</em>. The break tag &lt;br&gt; is an example of a void tag.
          It's easy to forget to add the closing tag for non-void tags, but you
          will often see the result of this error show up on the webpage, and a 
          good text editor, such as scratchpad.io will automatically create the 
          end tag as soon as you write the closing angled bracket on the opening 
          tag.<br><br>For more background on HTML and the Web, go

              Computers are unforegiving/literal/stupid. However,good <em>text
              editor</em> can help us keep track of what we are telling the
              computer bridging the gap between the human world of casual and
              interpretive communication and the literal, linear world of the
              computers. For a helpful, online and real-time text editor go

        <h2>Key Techniques and Methods</h2>
          <p>
             <b>HTML Attributes - new concept</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Tag attributes</em> are written in the opening tag(in the first
            set of angled brackets) after the letter or letters specifying the 
            type of tag. For example, an anchor tag that anchors a link has the 
            opening tag thusly:<br>&lt;a tag-attribute-here="some url webaddress
            here"&gt;. A tag attribute always equals some value, such as the url 
            of a webpage or a link to an image. Examples would be:<br>
            a href= www."udacity.com"
            Surround that with angled brackets, follow it with some text content 
            and then an end tag and you will have a link.
            anchors are the a's inside of angled brackets: they are for making
            links.
            <br>The image or img tag is a void tag: img src="url" alt= "txt"
            The alt= "some text here" gives the computers instructions on what
            to display to the user if the picture at the link is unavailable.
            <br>The letters src stand for <em>source</em>; an <em>image</em> or
            img always has a <em>source</em> or src just like an <em>achor</em>
            or a always has a <em>hypertext reference</em> or href.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Special Reminder</b>
          </p>
          <p>
             Do not forget to surround the url's of your attribute values with 
             quotation marks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Advice</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Be advised: in coding, there are so many facts to remember that 
            searching the web or consulting community forums is the norm. You 
            cannot expect to master all of the facts and be able to code without
            consulting other resources. You need to understand the key ideas and 
            then know where to go when you need help with the details.
          </p>
          <p>
             <b>Inline Elements vs. Block Elements</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Inline elements occupy the same line with text when you are writing 
            your code or HTML code. An example is the &lt;em&gt; element used to 
            italicize words within a larger body of text. In contrast, block
            elements are written on their own lines within the code and serve to
            set apart whatever they enclose.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Container Elements</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Container elemenents contain stuff inside of them. Examples of
            container elements are &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;. You can use &lt;div&gt;
            tags to nest boxs of text inside of other boxes by nesting the
            div tags. You can do the same with &lt;span&gt; tags.(span tags are
            inline elements; they demarcate boxes on one line). You do not see
            these boxes in the browser - they are invisible unless otherwise
            styled into view - but their effect is visible in how other elements
            on the webpage will appear to be demarcated and separated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>White Space</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>White space</em> or empty space in the code gets ignored by the
            browser when displaying or <em>rendering</em> the webpage. Text is
            rendered continuously on one line unless you tell the computer
            otherwise with appropriate tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Notes on Headings and Format</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Documents will often start and end with a tag that declares that it is
            an HTML document: &lt;html&gt;. The main body of a web page contents
            (including all tags within the body of the webpage) will be nested
            with a pair of tags &lt;body&gt; and its closing tag&lt;body&gt;. A 
            section above the body is demarcated as the head with a pair of tags:
            &lt;head&gt; and &lt;head&gt;. Within the head tags, the title tags and 
            title of the webpage will be specified (which the browser will render
            onto its tab associated with the webpage) as well as a link tag that
            serves to link the html code with the associated style file.

          <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Where HTML is analogous to the floor plan of a house, the CSS file 
          linked to the webpage if analougous to the stye plans and decoration
          of a house, and javascript is analogous to the machines, appliances, 
          and gadgets within the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Document Object Model</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Webbrowsers use HTML tags to built a tree-like structure of the nested
          hierarchies and sections that make up the webpage. This tree-like 
          structure is known as the<em>Document Object Model</em> or DOM. When 
          you use a browser to view the HTML code that is 'under the hood' of a 
          webpage, the browser will tag the various separate HTML elements with
          little triangles, which, when selected or clicked on, with expand to
          show the element in further detail, sort of like dissecting the webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Boxes</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Stated most simply, HTML structures a webpage into a bunch of boxes, 
          some of which are separate and some of which can contain...other boxes.
          When you see shapes on a webpage that are not boxes(e.g. circles,
          elipses, triangles) this has been accomplished by using the CSS file 
          linked to the HTML document for the page.

          <b>Cascading Style Sheets Prevent Repetition</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the code for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> (CSS) and
          linking CSS files with their HTML documents, web developers accomplish
          a number of efficiences for themselves, the internet, and the browser
          that is is ultimately rendering the page for the viewer. CSS code
          allows the developer to apply the same styling to multiple HTML
          elements. For example, the developer could apply the same styling to
          all &lt;h1&gt; tags or to all paragraphes or to all &lt;div&gt; items
          that share the attribute/value combination class="Desciption" or some
          other similar attribute. By avoiding repetition in coding for style, 
          CSS helps to reduce the number of 'moving parts' in the code of a 
          a webpage, the coder has less of a change to introduce errors
          (because) they are not typing as much, they will detect errors sooner
          (because a shorter body of code is more easy to read and review).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Abstraction Ennacted</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of CSS illustrate the centrality of abstraction or
          generalizability in computer science and programming. Coders, the code
          they write, and the computers that run their code can all accomplish
          more with less to the degree that like elements are grouped together
          and ennacted upon in concert via abstraction.

          <p>
          The specific a given CSS selector is, the more it will override other
          styles and selectors. For example, the CSS ID selector is very
          specific: in HTML it will look like &lt;div id="some_value"&gt;, and 
          the corresponding CSS selector would look like this: #some_value.
          That is, a hash symbol followed by the value of the id attribute 
          followed by the curly braces. The class selector is less specific,
          but allows for a certain amount of specificity. In HTML the attribute
          in the tag looks like this: class="some_value". The corresponding CSS
          selector uses a kind of dot-notation and would look like this:
          .some_value, followed by the opening curley brace.
